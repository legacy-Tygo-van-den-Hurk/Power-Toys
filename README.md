## My use case
This is a program that adds additional functionality and customizability to Windows. Examples of this are:
 - Key remapping
 - Window Managment
 - a SpotLight alternitive

and many more. I need this program to make windows easier to use and more like the way I want my opperating systems. 

I grew up with windows computers, but the first computer I took serieusly and did actual work on was a Mac. So I'm used to both their quirks. I really like some of the things a Mac has that Windows just doesn't do properly. I really like the Mac key bindings. CMD is located much better then CTRL and I use it more that way. So obviously that was the first thing I did. Switch CTRL and ALT so that it functioned as if CTRL was on the same spot as CMD. The same for the WIN key, I made that to function like an ALT key. After a few dozen itterations I've gotten my keyboard to function exactly as a Macs. Making the switch back and forth easier.

I litterally cannot live without spotlight. It is the main way for me to give commands to the computer. Want to open a file? Type the file name, and press enter. The computer should do the rest. Need to open a program? Type the programs name, and press enter. The computer should do the rest. Need to do a calculation? Type it in and ... You get the gist. Windows search wishes it was a good as Spotlight. Thankfully even for this, Powertoys has got an alternitive. Best part is that it works really good.

Without this program, interacting with windows machines, would be such a pain.
