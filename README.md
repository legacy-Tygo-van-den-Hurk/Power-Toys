# Power-Toys
This Repository will contain config and setting files for Microsoft PowerToys.

This is a program that adds functionality to windows. Examples of this are:
 - Key remapping
 - Window Managment
 - a SpotLight alternitive

and many more. I need this program to make windows easier to use and more like
the way I want my opperating systems.
